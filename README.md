# Sales-prices-of-houses-in-the-North-East-of-England
I scraped, cleaned and performed EDA on data from 'Rightmove'. I performed Linear regression to find selling prices for houses in the North East of England. 

The 'scraped data files' are the uncleaned data that I scraped from Rightmove.
The 'model' files are both linear regresion models for 2 different price ranges.
